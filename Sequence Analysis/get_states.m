function seqstates = get_states(seq, k)
% Get states from a sequence, using given kmer length (assumed 5).
% 'seq' should be nt2int integers.
% using 'R' for abasics in the nucleotide string works to give the integer
% 5, which is interpreted as abasic.
% If there are abasics, the imaginary part is the number of abasics at
% that kmer location.
