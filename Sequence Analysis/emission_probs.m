% emission_probs(level_mean, level_stdv, stdv_mean, p_noise, p_deep)
% returns the value of the pdf for a measured current of a given level
% Inputs:
% 'measurement' the observation(s): struct that contains two fields:
%       'level_mean' level's mean current
%       'level_stdv' standard deviation of level current
% 'measured_current_range' row 2-vector of of the entire current range
% 'state' is a struct that contains three fields:
%       'level_mean' level's mean current
%       'level_stdv' standard deviation of level current
%       'stdv_mean' standard deviation of level's mean current
% 'p_noise' the a priori probability of observing a junk noise value
% 'p_deep' the a priori probability of observing a deep block level
% 'p_scale' the scale factor for the states
% 'p_offset' the offset for the states (applied after scale)
